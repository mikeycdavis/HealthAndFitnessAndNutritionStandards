# Release-review dispositions

Independent content-review results for the four rules that apply to this repository and that no
machine evaluates.

**A disposition is not an attestation.** None of these supplies a `reviewedBy` human identity, and
none of them makes `standards check .` report anything different. A human reviewer may use a
disposition and its evidence chain when deciding whether to record an attestation in
`project-policy.yml`; the human's acceptance is what becomes the attestation, and
`reviewedAgainst.paths` should name both the reviewed material and the packs that framed it.

## `health.no-fabricated-medical-facts` — ESTABLISHABLE

```text
health.no-fabricated-medical-facts

Independent content-review disposition:
ESTABLISHABLE

Initial review:
DEFECTIVE

Remediation reviewed:
79d39d1

Basis:
The empirical corpus was reviewed at claim granularity.
No fabricated physiological mechanism was identified.
Claims found to exceed their evidentiary support were remediated
at the content layer without weakening the governing rule or evaluator.
Focused rereview finds the blocking defects resolved.
```

**Evidence chain.** [Pack 03](03-health-no-fabricated-medical-facts.md) framed the review ·
[pack 03a](03a-claim-extract.md) supplied the 191 claims verbatim ·
[pack 03b](03b-remediation-diff.md) is the before/after for the thirty that changed.

**Review history.**

| Step | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Pack 03 delivered | Reviewer declined to review from categories and exemplars; required the claims themselves |
| Pack 03a delivered (`18a7e8a`) | Corpus corrected from 73 to 191 entries / 182 distinct |
| First disposition | **DEFECTIVE** — six blocking findings, eight non-blocking |
| Remediation (`79d39d1`) | Content narrowed or reframed; rule, evaluator, and policy untouched |
| Focused re-review of the thirty changed claims | **ESTABLISHABLE** |

**What the reviewer recorded about the nature of the defects.** No invented physiology was found.
Every defect was a real finding stated past its evidence — the failure
[Standard 14](../../standards/14-evidence-quality.md) R2 names as the most common one, written by an
author who had read R2 while writing it.

### Finding raised outside the reviewed corpus

`standards/30-adherence.md` R1 previously read *"the first wins by a margin that no programming
refinement approaches"* — characterised by the reviewer as rhetorical quantification masquerading as
comparative magnitude. It was outside the 182-claim corpus and was explicitly **not** used to reject
the rule. Corrected on its own merits:

> A suboptimal plan that is consistently performed can outperform an optimal plan that is abandoned,
> and over a long enough horizon it usually does.

## `escalation.tier-language-calibrated` — not yet reviewed

Next in the queue, and placed there because its potentially-urgent worked example carries the highest
consequence in the repository if the calibration is wrong. Material in
[pack 01](01-escalation-tier-language-calibrated.md) and [pack 01a](01a-tier-language-corpus.md).

## `trend.trends-over-events` — not yet reviewed

Material in [pack 02](02-trend-trends-over-events.md).

## `nutrition.no-single-food-disease-claims` — not yet reviewed

Material in [pack 04](04-nutrition-no-single-food-disease-claims.md). Pack 04 records one gap in
advance: the prohibition has no worked violating example anywhere in the repository.

## Release state

Three of four rules remain unreviewed, so `standards check .` reports `NOT_EVALUATED` and exits 4.
That is the correct state and it is left that way. No attestation has been recorded, and nothing is
tagged.
